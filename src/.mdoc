# Twitter Detoxifier: Project Documentation # 1. Introduction & Overview # This document outlines the plan and details for the Twitter Detoxifier project. # The primary goal of this project is to create a tool that helps users curate and "detoxify" their
# Twitter feed, providing a more positive and controlled social media experience. # 2. Problem Statement # Many users find their Twitter feeds overwhelming, filled with negativity, or content they'd prefer to avoid. # This can lead to stress, anxiety,
and # a generally unpleasant user experience. # There is a need for a tool that empowers users to filter and manage the content they see. # 3. Proposed Solution # The Twitter Detoxifier will be a [Web Application/Browser Extension/Mobile App - CHOOSE
ONE OR SPECIFY] # that interacts with the user's Twitter account (potentially via the Twitter API). # It will allow users to define filters, rules, and preferences to automatically hide or flag undesirable tweets, accounts, or keywords. # 4. Key Features
(Planned) # * **Keyword/Phrase Filtering:** Allow users to specify words or phrases that, if present in a tweet, will cause it to be hidden or flagged. # * **User/Account Muting/Blocking:** Advanced muting or blocking options beyond Twitter's native capabilities
(e.g., temporary mutes, # mutes based on account characteristics). # * **Content-Type Filtering:** Options to filter out specific types of media (e.g., videos, images with certain characteristics if feasible). # * **Sentiment Analysis (Optional):** Potentially
integrate sentiment # analysis to flag or hide overly negative tweets. # * **Customizable Whitelists/Blacklists:** Allow users to maintain lists of accounts/keywords to always show or always hide. # * **Detoxification Summary/Report:** Show users stats
on how many tweets were # filtered. # * **User-Friendly Interface:** An intuitive and easy-to-use dashboard for managing settings. # * **Timer-based Blocking:** Allow users to set timers to block access to Twitter for specific durations (hours/minutes)
to encourage focused work or # breaks. # 5. Technical Stack (Preliminary) # * **Frontend:** [e.g., React, Vue, Vanilla JS, HTML, CSS - TBD] # * **Backend:** [e.g., Python (Flask/Django), Node.js (Express) - TBD] # * **Database:** [e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB,
SQLite - TBD] # * **APIs:** Twitter # API (if applicable and permissions allow) # * **Other Libraries/Frameworks:** [TBD] # 6. Setup & Installation (Placeholder) # *(Details on how to set up the development environment and install the application will
go here.)* # 7. Usage (Placeholder) # *(Instructions # on how to use the Twitter Detoxifier once it's built.)* # 8. Future Enhancements (Ideas) # * Machine learning-based content suggestions. # * Integration with other social media platforms. # * Community-shared
filter lists. # --- # *This is a living document and # will be updated as the project progresses.*
